Calories Burnt Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting the number of calories burnt during exercise based on various physiological and activity-related factors.

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing information about users, their physical attributes (Gender, Age, Height, Weight), exercise duration, heart rate, body temperature, and the corresponding calories burnt.

Model
An XGBoost Regressor model is used for predicting calories burnt. XGBoost is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its performance and efficiency.
